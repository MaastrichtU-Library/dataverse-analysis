This repository contains Python code to analyze and visualize [DataverseNL](https://dataverse.nl/) administrative data. The analysis considers an overview of the dataverses general usage based on a parent dataverse. Specifically, this one uses Maastricht University's Dataverse `root` URL, and is maintained by the University Library. It can be adapted to any Dataverse

## Usage

- The `dataverse_analysis.py` script can be used to perform the analysis and generate visualizations. Alternatively, you can use the included Jupyter notebook (`dataverse_analysis.ipynb`) for a more interactive experience.

- To use this code, you will need to provide a token from your Dataverse repository, which should be placed in a file named `TOKEN.txt` in the same directory as the Python script/notebook. To generate a token go to your user account on [API Generation](https://dataverse.nl/dataverseuser.xhtml?selectTab=apiTokenTab) section.
